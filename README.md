# Kryptos K4 — AI-Assisted Decryption Attempt

⚠️ Retraction Notice
This repository contains an early AI-assisted hypothesis attempting to decrypt Kryptos K4, the final unsolved panel of Jim Sanborn’s Kryptos sculpture.

As of July 2025, the author acknowledges that the hypothesis presented here is not correct, and does not align with confirmed plaintext clues (e.g., “EASTNORTHEAST,” “BERLIN,” and “CLOCK”) or accepted cryptographic methods used in K4.

This repo is preserved for transparency, archival context, and to document the exploratory process — including where it went wrong and what can be learned from it.

For future researchers:
Please treat this as a withdrawn hypothesis, not a confirmed solution.

## Overview
This repository documents what may be the first semantically aligned and reproducible decryption of Kryptos K4 — CIA's legendary 97-character cipher unsolved for over 30 years.

We used an AI-assisted genetic algorithm to derive the key:

**Key:** `GONSCTGB`

The decrypted message reveals fragments such as:

> "Abandon contact near the Berlin clock. Encrypt the file. Conceal it underground. Escape route compromised."

Updated Interpretation (June 30, 2025)
In response to community feedback, we’ve updated our interpretation to explicitly include “EASTNORTHEAST,” which appears in the decrypted text at positions 22–34. Below are three refined message options that retain semantic alignment with spycraft tone and Sanborn's known plaintexts:

>Option A:
Abandon contact east-northeast of the Berlin clock. Encrypt the file. Conceal it underground. Escape route compromised.

>Option B:
Abandon contact. Encrypt the file. Coordinates: EASTNORTHEAST. Conceal it underground. Escape route compromised.

>Option C:
Abandon contact. Encrypt the file. Move east-northeast of the Berlin clock. Conceal it underground. Escape route compromised.

These refinements maintain coherence with the decrypted structure and bring the interpretation fully in line with all confirmed Kryptos K4 clues.
