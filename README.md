# Kryptos K4 — AI-Assisted Decryption Attempt

## Overview
This repository documents what may be the first semantically aligned and reproducible decryption of Kryptos K4 — CIA's legendary 97-character cipher unsolved for over 30 years.

We used an AI-assisted genetic algorithm to derive the key:

**Key:** `GONSCTGB`

The decrypted message reveals fragments such as:

> "Abandon contact near the Berlin clock. Encrypt the file. Conceal it underground. Escape route compromised."

## Files Included
- `ciphertext.txt`: The full K4 ciphertext
- `key.txt`: The Vigenère key
- `output.txt`: The decrypted result
- `decrypt.py`: Python script to reproduce the decryption

## Timeline
This repo was created and timestamped before public Substack and Reddit release.
